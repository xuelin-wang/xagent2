# Development Project

This directory is for development-only code and experiments. It is not part of
any production project.

What belongs here:
- Scratch Python modules for quick experiments.
- Notebooks for exploration or demos.
- One-off scripts or helpers you don't want inside a component/base yet.

What does not belong here:
- Production code. Put that in `components/` or `bases/`.

Notes:
- There are no required files in this directory.
- Add and remove files freely; keep it lightweight and focused on developer
  workflow.
