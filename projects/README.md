# Projects

Projects are deployable artifacts that wire selected bases/components into a
deliverable (application, service, library, or package).

What belongs here:
- Project-level configuration and dependencies.
- Packaging metadata and entry-point definitions for the deliverable.
- Composition of bases/components for a specific deployment.

What does not belong here:
- Business logic (put that in `components/`).
- Dev-only experiments (put those in `development/`).
